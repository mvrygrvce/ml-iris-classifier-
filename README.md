# ml-iris-classifier-
A simple yet powerful machine learning app that classifies iris flowers species using Scikit-learm. Built for learning, sharing and showcasing ML workflows - from data to deployment. 

Model Overview: 
Input: Sepal length, sepal width, petal width
Output: Predicted Iris Species (Setosa, versicolor, virginica)
Algorithm: sklearn.ensemble.IrisClassifier

This project is part of my journey into machine learning and ethical AI. I’m exploring creative, transparent, and reproducible workflows — and sharing them to help others learn too.
